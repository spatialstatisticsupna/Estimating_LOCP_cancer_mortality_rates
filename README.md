# Note <a name="Note"/>

Due to confidentiality issue the original data used in the paper has been modified. So the code used in the paper and presented [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Estimating_LOCP_cancer_mortality_rates/tree/main/R), can be used to replicate but not to reproduce the results shown.

# R code <a name="Rcode"/>
R code to replicate the spatial multivariate model described in the paper and the results has been included [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Estimating_LOCP_cancer_mortality_rates/tree/main/R).
